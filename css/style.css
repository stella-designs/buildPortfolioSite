* Created this fake file as the review would not seem to go through without a file with this name
* I simply used/edited/added to bootstrap to style my HTML, was told this was okay:
* Checked with live help: "the reviewer made a mistake and that you meet the file structure
* specifications from the Separation of Concerns requirement that says: "Files are organized with
* a directory structure that separates files based on functionality. For example: css/ for
* stylesheets img/ for images js/ for JavaScript files"
